  Generated Interrupt Manager Header File

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    interrupt_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the Interrupt Manager file generated using MPLAB� Code Configurator

  @Description:
    This header file provides implementations for global interrupt handling.
    For individual peripheral handlers please see the peripheral driver for
    all modules selected in the GUI.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB� Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC16F1716
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00
